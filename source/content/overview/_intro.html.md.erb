## Intro to Tuum Tech

Welcome to the Tuum Tech documentation site! You can use our API to access Assist and Profile API endpoints to interact with Decentralized Identifiers(DIDs) and the data associated with them.

We have language bindings in Shell, Python, and JavaScript! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.
